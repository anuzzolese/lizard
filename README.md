# Lizard
Lizard automatically generates language-agnostic APIs for accessing knowledge bases without knowing of Semantic Web languages (such as RDF, OWL or SPARQL).
Given as input the ontology describing the knowledge base, Lizard generates a Java library for accessing the target knowledge base.
Lizard exposes the RDF triples contained in the KB as sets of resources and seamlessly integrates them into the Object Oriented paradigm.
